# RevenueCalculator
A small script I created for my business that helps me calculate net income from various job types once I input them. 
It also calculatues how many job types I must complete to achieve an inputted profit amount per month. 
It was created as an exercise in usuing a bit of OOP with classes and functions in order to create a practical script that I would consistently use. 
A GUI with PyQt5 will be the next step.

# RevenueCalculator
A small script for my business to help me calculate how many jobs of a certain type I need to complete to achieve an inputted revenue amount per month. It will also show net income.
It was created as an exercise in OOP and to create a practical script that I would consistenly use. 
A GUI with PyQt5 will be the next step.
